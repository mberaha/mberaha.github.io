### Abstract
We propose a semiparametric VAR model with exogenous covariates for nonstationary multidimensional longitudinal data,
where a dependent stick-breaking prior is assumed for the autoregressive component through logit stick-breaking. 
We develop an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for MCMC posterior simulation, leveraging recent results on 
logit stick-breaking priors. We also illustrate the approach through simulations and medical data.

I was awarded a travel grant to present this research project.
