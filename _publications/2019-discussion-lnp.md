In this work, we comment on the article by Camerlenghi and co authors, proposing
an approximation to their latent nested process, that we obtain by
truncating a priori the stick-breaking construction of a nested Dirichlet Process.

We implement the model using JAGS and extend to the case when more than two
subpopulations are compared.
