Hi there! I am a first year PhD researcher at the Math. Department at Politecnico di Milano, where I work under the supervision of professor Alessandra Guglielmi.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at [Indigo AI][1] developing cool NLP stuff to produce smarter chatbots.

Before that, I was an intern at [BrotherTongue][2] developing cool NLP stuff to help language learners.

Before that, I was a Mathematical Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano.
